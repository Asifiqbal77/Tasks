# Task 05

## Overview
For this task, I recreated the Keefer Law Firm PLC website design. The main goal was to replicate the provided layout with pixel-perfect accuracy, matching spacing, fonts, colors, and overall structure exactly like the reference design.

This website uses a classic legal theme with a Dark Red + Gray color palette and includes textured backgrounds for the navigation bar, buttons, and footer.

To improve my skills, I implemented the same design in two different ways:

- Tailwind CSS Version** (Utility-based styling)
- Pure HTML & CSS Version** (Custom CSS from scratch)

Both versions look identical and are **free of code comments.

## How to View the Project
You can view either version by opening the HTML file in any modern browser:

- Tailwind Version: Open `src/Tailwind/index.html`
- Pure CSS Version: Open `src/HTML-CSS/index.html`

> Note: Please keep the `images/` folder in the same location so textures, icons, and assets load properly.



## What I Built

### Design Details
- Typography: Serif fonts (Georgia / Times New Roman) were used for headings to match the official legal style.
- Two-Tone Headings: Titles like PRACTICE AREAS use two different colors (Gray + Red) exactly like the reference design.
- Textured UI: Instead of plain colors, I used the provided texture assets for:
  - Navigation background
  - Red buttons
  - Footer background



## Asset Usage
I carefully analyzed the provided `images/` folder and used the assets exactly as required, including:

- Menu background texture (`menu_bg.gif`)
- Button background texture (`pra_bg_red.gif`)
- Footer background (`ft_bg.png`)
- Section separator shadow (`hr_shadow.png`)
- List bullets (`bullet_red.gif`)
- Hero / banner images
- Badges and logos
  - Avvo rating badges
  - National College badges



## Responsiveness
The website is fully responsive and mobile-friendly. On smaller screens:

- The navigation menu hides and shows a menu icon
- The layout stacks into a single-column layout
- The hero section and form adjust properly for mobile screens
- The "Call Our Offices" banner scales to fit smaller widths

## Tech Stack
- HTML5 – Structure and semantic layout
- CSS3 – Custom styling (Pure CSS version)
- Tailwind CSS – Utility-based styling (Tailwind version via CDN)
